# ðŸ”°Requirements -

## ðŸ”³Introduction:

 - Myself Shreyash and I am working on my Mini Project called Vaccine Registration.
 - COVIDâ€‘19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. 
 - Each vaccine centre will operate locally to register and allot vaccines.

## ðŸ”³Research:
 - The data handling for online basic registration will be mostly done in the day time and the data acquired by the local centres of vaccinated people can be handled in the night.

## ðŸ”³Features:
- This software can be used by different persons by using different user names and passwords.

## ðŸ”³Project Mini Requirements:
- Visual Code Studio with C compiler.
- Ubuntu (LINUX)
- Github (Pull and Pushing the code)

## ðŸ”†4 W's and 1 H
