### Introduction:

 - Myself Shreyash and I am working on my Mini Project called Vaccine Registration.
 - COVIDâ€‘19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. 
 - Each vaccine centre will operate locally to register and allot vaccines. The basic registration can be done online and schedules are set as desired by the patient. Assuming a vaccination centre can vaccinate around 100 people in a day. 

 ### Research:
 - The data handling for online basic registration will be mostly done in the day time and the data acquired by the local centres of vaccinated people can be handled in the night.

### Features:
- This software can be used by different persons by using different user names and passwords.

### Project Mini Requirements:
- Visual Code Studio with C compiler.
- Ubuntu (LINUX)
- Github (Pull and Pushing the code)

### SWOT Analysis:
