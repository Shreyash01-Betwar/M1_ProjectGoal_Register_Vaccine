## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome
1. **The initial challenges:** with Unit Testing and Code Coverage.
2. **Generation of makefile:** To overcome this problem research on makefiles was done.
3. **Mid Phase:** Actual Challenge on Debugging to make a code more Robust.
3. **Unity testing:** Initially a few testcases did not pass, to overcome this issue debugging of program was performed.
